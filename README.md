## Welcome

Welcome to the GDG Nashik Open Design Repo. Here you can file issues with your design requests for the design group, find collaborators, or find design tasks to tackle. Don't forget to use the Issue Template below to make sure you are including all the relevant information!

Anyone can take (or make) a design issue, as long as it is related to Rust.

NOTE: Once you've completed a project please include the source files!
